Debugging Guide:

Serial Communications:

General failure to program:
	Unplug board, plug back in.  Repeat with radio. 
	Check if lights on board are on appropriately (all on as of latest revision). If not, issue is at board. Use MpLab and ICD3 to reprogram bootloader.  

Nonetype has no attribute "write":
	Change the USB port in your bootload line to the radio USB (probably ttyUSB#)

Process hangs with an "Unknown device is found", then "Done"
	Check destination address in /bootloader/imageproc/host/bootloader2.py

Process hangs with DEBUG /command... Done
	Check that your board is set up to communicate with the radio you are using.  If it is not, find the correct radio and use that. This info is in SConstruct file- check that you are using the correct macro for your board.  Macros are named after the corresponding board.

	orange radio = x0100, works with board C5 (address x00 x15)
	white radio = x0101, works with board C2 (address x20 x02)

Echo/testLED not working:
	Use sniffer and ZENA (installed on lab computer) to check if messages are being sent and where.  Only the first few columns are relevant. If destination address is wrong (i.e.  not that of the board) change the address in dynaroach.py and reload the module or reinstantiate your DynaRoach object with the correct address. 
	If the board is sending data, but to the wrong address, reprogram it over the radio with the correct macro.
